What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file is added into the repository and it says there are untracked files in that directory.
We need to initialise a repository to indicate that it'll serve as our git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate stage in between working directory and repository. It's just to make sure what you're doing is right.
