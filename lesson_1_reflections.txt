What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pro of simultaneous commits - maintains consistency, with improper error tracking.
Pro of batch commits like in GitHub - Consistent and easy to track code changes and errors.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is mainly built to store code repositories, while Google Docs is primarily to store general purpose documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
first get log with all IDs for commits, then use IDs to find the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
We always have a backup for the previous work.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use Git to apply version control on all my future projects.
